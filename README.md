# Crash Detection Application - Team 4

## Our Goal
The goal for this project is to create a prototype for an application to detect crashes while skiing, if a crash is detected the app will start a timer, after a certain amount of time is elapsed it will automatically call the rescuers that are on call at the ski resort.

## Development Plan
- Use gyroscope and accelerometer for sensing
- Avoid accidental readings
- Emergency button for manual calling
- Communication with ski patrol

- Pick 3 resorts and use trail map
  - Use inspiration from Epic
  - Live map for ski patrol
  - Live tracker (GPS for long/lat + altitude)
  - Show options for resorts based on proximity
